**Update (April 18, 2016):** For a more detailed mathematical analysis, see
[this post][sensan].

**Update (April 17, 2016):** What I call the *Japanese bracket cost function*
below seems to already be known as the *Pseudo-Huber loss function*. See
[this][wiki-huber] Wikipedia page for references.


## Background and motivation

Many machine-learning problems can be formulated as minimizing a
training cost plus a regularization cost. The simplest example is linear
regression, in which for training data $X$ and labels $y$, one seeks to solve
the problem:

$$
\min_{W, b} \textrm{cost}(X \cdot W + b - y) + C \cdot\textrm{reg_cost}(W) \,.
$$

Here $W$ and $b$ are the coefficients to be fitted and $C$ is a hyperparameter
that controls the strength of the regularization.

Two widely-used cost functions are the squared $\ell^2$ norm and the $\ell^1$
norm. If $z$ is an $n$-dimensional vector, these are given by:

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{1}{n} ||z||_{\ell^2}^2 &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i|^2 \,, \label{l2}
\\ \frac{1}{n} ||z||_{\ell^1} &= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n |z_i| \,. \label{l1}
\end{align}
$$

For example, the squared-$\ell^2$ norm is used as both the cost and
regularization cost in [Ridge regression][ridge], and in
[Lasso regression][lasso], the squared-$\ell^2$ norm is still used for
the training cost, but the $\ell^1$ norm is used for regularization.
(The motivation for using $\ell^1$ in this context is to make $W$ sparse.)


**The purpose of this article is:**

1. To raise awareness that for heavy-tailed noise the squared $\ell^2$ norm is
   not a suitable cost function: least squares regression will likely fail.
2. To introduce the Japanese bracket cost function that *does* work well for
   heavy-tailed noise. It is a smooth interpolation between the $\ell^1$ and
   squared $\ell^2$ costs.


## Heavy-tailed noise and least-squares regression

Let's distort samples from the line $y = 3 + 50x$ by some [Cauchy][cauchy]
heavy-tailed noise.

~~~python
import numpy as np
x = np.linspace(0, 100, 500)
y_noisy = 3 + 50 * x + 20 * np.random.standard_cauchy(500)
~~~

Here is an example of what we get if we try to recover $y$ from the noisy data
using least-squares regression (i.e. squared $\ell^2$ training cost):

~~~raw
         True: 50.000 + 3.000 * x
    Recovered: -362.910 + 8.056 * x
~~~

That doesn't look so good. The problem is that the quadratic growth
of the cost function makes it too sensitive to the outliers.

**Upshot:** Least-squares regression is a disaster for Cauchy noise.


## Heavy-tailed noise and the $\ell^1$ norm

So what if we use the $\ell^1$ norm instead? It only grows linearly,
so it should be much less sensitive to the outliers. Indeed, the results
look much better:

~~~raw
         True: 50.000 + 3.000 * x
    Recovered: 47.083 + 3.007 * x
~~~

## The Japanese bracket cost

So using the $\ell^1$ norm solves our problem in this case. However,
it does have one defect: The absolute value function $|\cdot|$
is not differentiable at the origin. That is, we like the behavior of
$|z|$ for large $|z|$ (linear growth), but its behavior for small
$|z|$ leaves much to be desired&emdash;we were better off with the squared
$\ell^2$ norm in that regime.

The solution is to use the *Japanese bracket*

$$
\langle z \rangle := \sqrt{1 + |z|^2}
$$

instead of the absolute value function. (This name and notation are
widespread in the *partial differential equations* literature, but I have
been unable to trace their origin.) The point is that

$$
\langle z \rangle \approx \begin{cases}
        1 + \frac12 |z|^2 \,, & \text{for $z \ll 1$}\,,
    \\  |z| \,,               & \text{for $z \gg 1$}\,.
\end{cases}
$$

Thus, $\langle z \rangle - 1$ is a smooth function that interpolates
between quadratic behavior for small $z$ and linear growth for large $z$.

Geometrically, it is nice to think about these cost functions in terms of
quadric (hyper)surfaces: $y = \frac12 |z|^2$ defines a paraboloid, whereas
$y = |z|$ defines a cone, which is a degenerate hyperboloid. The Japanese
bracket comes from solving $y^2 = 1 + |z|^2$, which is a nondegenerate
hyperboloid.

![Cone, parabola, and hyperbola](/assets/cost_funcs_as_quadrics.png)

With this in mind and in analogy with $\eqref{l2}$ and $\eqref{l1}$,
we define the *Japanese bracket* cost to be

$$
\textrm{japanese}(z) = \frac{\eta^2}{n} \sum_i \left(
    \sqrt{ 1 + \left( \frac{|z_i|}{\eta} \right)^2 } - 1
\right) \,,
$$

where $\eta$ is a positive scale parameter. In principle, $\eta$ can be
optimized just like any other hyperparameter: Just make sure to use a
metric like $\ell^1$ for the cross-validation that is independent of $\eta$.
In practice, if the training data is pre-scaled, $\eta$ can simply
be taken as, say, $0.1$.)

Choosing somewhat arbitrarily $\eta = 10$ for the non-scaled data in
this post, here finally are the results of the fit using the Japanese
bracket cost. They are comparable with the $\ell^1$ results.

~~~raw
         True: 50.000 + 3.000 * x
    Recovered: 47.135 + 2.998 * x
~~~

## Code

The regressions in this post were computed using a custom scikit-learn
estimator. Please see `flexible_linear.py` and `heavytail.ipynb` in
[this repository][custom-sklearn].


## Credit

For more on the observation that least-squares regression is not suitable for
heavy-tailed noise, see, e.g., [Schick and Mitter][schick-mitter]
([PDF][schick-mitter-pdf]).

I learned about this issue from my mentor George Bordakov when I was an
intern at Schlumberger. We introduced the Japanese bracket cost
[here][eage-doi] (paywall) to deal with heavy-tailed noise in well-log
sharpening (a geophysical inverse problem).
