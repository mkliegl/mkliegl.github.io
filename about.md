I am interested in mathematics, machine learning, and data science.

I hope to maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio on this blog, emphasizing
*quality* and *originality* over *quantity*.


## Research interests

I am broadly interested in pursuing meaningful research and
applications involving mathematics, machine learning, and/or data science.

My PhD thesis ([PDF][thesis-PDF]) is about inviscid incompressible fluids.
Two highlights are:

- A systematic study of the orthogonal invariants of the incompressible
3d Euler equations.
- A new model for liquid-vapor-solid systems that clarifies what goes on at
the contact line (where the three phases meet). This is of importance
when studying small length scales: see, for example, Bush and Hu's
nice pictures of [water insects][water-insects].

In various internships and as an undergraduate student, I also worked
on:

- a geophysical inverse problem
  ([patent application][slb-patent], [paywall article][eage-doi])
- data center network design ([tech report][dcell-tr], [paywall article][dcell-doi])
- quantum random walks ([arXiv][qrw-arxiv], [paywall article][qrw-doi])
- inverse problems related to EEG data

## About me

At internships at [Schlumberger][schlumberger] and [Microsoft Research Asia][msra],
I worked on geophysical inverse problems and data center network design,
respectively. Recently, I worked as a data science consultant
at [Oncora Medical][oncora].

My educational background:

- **Princeton University**, PhD, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Jan 2016
- **University of Chicago**, MS, Mathematics, Dec 2011
- **Swarthmore College**, BA, Mathematics with Minor in Physics, May 2010
